# Restaurant Menu (Flutter)

A scrollable digital menu application that simulates a food ordering experience. This project moves beyond static layouts to teach **Dynamic Lists**, showing you how to render data arrays efficiently using the builder pattern.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By building this project, you will learn:
- **ListView.builder:** How to render potentially infinite lists efficiently (only drawing what is on screen).
- **Data Models:** Creating custom Dart classes (`FoodItem`) to structure your application data.
- **ListTile:** Using the standard Flutter widget for rows with images, titles, and trailing icons.
- **SnackBar:** Displaying temporary popup messages when the user interacts with an item.

## 📱 Features
- **Scrollable Feed:** A smooth list of food items with images and prices.
- **Data Driven:** The UI is generated entirely from a Dart list, not hardcoded widgets.
- **Interaction:** Tapping the "Add" button triggers a confirmation popup.
- **Currency Formatting:** Handling decimal prices (e.g., `$12.99`) properly.
